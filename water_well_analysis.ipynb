    "# Predicting Tanzanian Water Well Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Diana Terry Awuor Aloo  \n",
    "**Project:** AI for Sustainable Water Access — Tanzanian Water Well Classification  \n",
    "**Repository:**  `Tanzanian-Water-Well-Classification--Phase-3-Project`\n",

    "## 1. Business Understanding (CRISP-DM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Stakeholders\n",
    "- **Primary:** Tanzanian Ministry of Water & Irrigation, local water agencies, and NGOs (e.g., WaterAid, UNICEF).  \n",
    "- **Secondary:** Donor organizations, field maintenance teams, local communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "Many water points (wells) in Tanzania become non-functional or fall into disrepair. This results in communities losing reliable access to clean water and wastes limited maintenance resources.  \n",
    "I will **build a predictive classification model** that forecasts the operational status of a water point (e.g., *functional*, *functional needs repair*, *non-functional*) based on installation, environmental, and usage features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "- **Primary objective:** Provide a model that **accurately identifies wells at risk of failure** so stakeholders can prioritize inspections and allocate repair budgets efficiently.\n",
    "- **Secondary objectives:**\n",
    "  - Identify key features associated with failing wells (e.g., installer, pump type, age).\n",
    "  - Provide prescriptive recommendations for improving well longevity (e.g., preferred pump types or installer practices).\n",
    "  - Package a reproducible notebook + trained model for handoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Data Science Objectives\n",
    "- Build an end-to-end predictive pipeline that includes:\n",
    "  - EDA and feature engineering\n",
    "  - Baseline interpretable model (Logistic Regression or single Decision Tree)\n",
    "  - Tuned model(s) (regularized logistic regression, tuned decision tree, and an ensemble as optional)\n",
    "  - Model evaluation with appropriate classification metrics (training + test)\n",
    "- Demonstrate reproducibility (clear code, saved model artifacts, README).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Success Criteria & Metrics\n",
    "I will Choose metrics that align with stakeholder priorities. For this project I will focus on:\n",
    "- **Primary metric:** *F1-score* for the *non-functional* class (balances precision & recall when false positives and false negatives both matter).\n",
    "- **Complementary metrics:** Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, and **ROC-AUC** (macro or per-class where appropriate).  \n",
    "- **Operational threshold example:** If the model achieves **F1 ≥ 0.65** on the holdout test set for the non-functional class, it will be considered viable for pilot deployment (example target — adjust after EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why F1 for non-functional?**  \n",
    "False negatives (missed failing wells) may leave communities without water; false positives waste repair resources. F1 balances both concerns. We may also prioritize **Recall** if avoiding missed failures is more critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.8 Next steps\n",
    "Proceed to **Data Understanding**:\n",
    "- Load training and label CSVs\n",
    "- Merge features and labels into a single DataFrame\n",
    "- Inspect columns, datatypes, missingness, and target balance\n",
    "- Create initial EDA visuals (target distribution, key numeric feature histograms)\n"
